 - 30 seconds to introduce your team members
   - Pieter
   - Jocelyne
   - Joe can't join us today
   - We are team gig squad
 - ~1 minute to talk through your plans, flow diagram, and project management
   - we didn't produce a flow diagram because it didn't make sense to
   - we did our planning as cards on GitHub projects converted to issues. we did not establish milestones or tasklists due to the short timescale
   - we used objectives as issues to ensure that we meet them all
   - we each decided to take on our own stretch goals outside of hours
     - I implemented jsdoc for documentation
     - Pieter has a surprise!
 - ~3 minutes to demo your final product and walk through specific parts of your code you think are interesting, or you're particularly proud of
 - ~1 minute for your reflections on how you worked as a team, what in your project went well, and what youâ€™d improve/change for next time
   - what went well:
     - restricting work on stretch goals to out of hours
     - documentation
     - clean, well commented code
     - album art implementation
   - what could have been better:
     - we didn't have time to implement error handling on the routes
   - next time
     - implement error handling from the start
     - things often take twice as long as you expect - take that into account next time
